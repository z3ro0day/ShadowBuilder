# ShadowBuilder — Virus Payload Builder  

## ShadowBuilder is a Windows **Virus** builder written in Python.  

- I included the mp4, mp3, ico, and png file for a demo. If you want to use your own just rename your files to default and default1.
- **default is for audio**
- **default1 is for video**
